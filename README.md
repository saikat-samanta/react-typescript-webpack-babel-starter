This is a starter project for React applications written in TypeScript. It includes a basic setup for webpack, Babel, Jest, and Storybook. It also has Prettier and ESLint set up for code formatting and linting.

This project is intended to be a starting point for new projects, so it is not intended to be a full-featured application.

To run the project:

1. Clone the repository and run `yarn` to install the dependencies.
2. Run `yarn start` to start the development server at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
3. Run `yarn build` to build the project for specific environment mention inside env.
4. Run `yarn storybook` to start Storybook at [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006).
5. Run `yarn test` to run the test suite.
6. Run `yarn test:watch` to run the test suite in watch mode.
7. Run `yarn test:ci` to run the test suite in CI mode (used by the CI server).
8. Run `yarn test:coverage` to generate a test coverage report.
9. Run `yarn test:coverage:report` to open the test coverage report in your default browser.
10. Run `yarn pretty` to format the code using Prettier.
11. Run `yarn analyze` to run the production build and generate a bundle analyzer report.
